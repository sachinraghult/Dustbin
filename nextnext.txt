tell me the one that works for ldap connections mainly
1 minute ago

For direct LDAP connections without needing the complex JPype/JDBC setup, you have two primary options. Since you are in a restricted environment where installing C++ compilers is an issue, the first one is your best bet.
1. python-oracledb (Recommended)
This is the modern, official replacement for cx_Oracle. Its Thin mode is completely written in Python and requires no C++ compilers or Oracle Instant Client installations. 
How it works for LDAP: While Thin mode doesn't natively parse LDAP URLs as connection strings by default, it provides a feature called register_protocol(). You can write a small "hook" function using a lightweight library like ldap3 to resolve your LDAP URL into the actual database hostname and service name on the fly.
Best for: Restricted environments (like yours) where you need a quick, compiler-free setup. 
2. cx_Oracle (Legacy)
This was the industry standard for years but is now considered obsolete. 
How it works for LDAP: It supports LDAP connections but requires you to have the Oracle Instant Client installed on your machine. You must also manually create and configure two specific text files—ldap.ora and sqlnet.ora—in your network admin directory to tell the driver how to resolve the LDAP names.
The Catch: This driver often requires the same C++ build tools that you are currently having trouble with. 
Comparison for your Pain Point
Feature 	python-oracledb (Thin)	cx_Oracle
Requires C++ Compiler?	No	Yes (usually)
LDAP Support?	Via custom hook	Via configuration files
Oracle Client Needed?	No	Yes
Installation	Simple pip install	Complex setup
Next Step: Would you like a Python code snippet showing how to implement the LDAP "hook" for python-oracledb so you can test it with your specific ldap://danoid... URL?
